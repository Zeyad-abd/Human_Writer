**Human Writer - Typing Simulation Program**
Overview
Human Writer is a Python-based GUI application that simulates realistic human typing behavior. The program allows users to input text and watch it being typed out automatically, complete with natural pauses, variable speeds, and breaks between words. The typing speed can be adjusted dynamically, and the program provides an estimated time for typing out the entire text based on the current speed settings.

Features
Text Input: Enter any text that you want the program to type out automatically.
Realistic Typing Simulation: The program simulates human-like typing with random speed variations, pauses, and breaks to mimic natural typing behavior.
Speed Control: Adjust the typing speed using "+" and "-" buttons. The current speed setting is displayed on the interface.
Start/Stop Typing: Use a toggle button to start or stop the typing simulation at any time.
Estimated Time Display: The program estimates and displays the time required to type out the text based on the current speed.
Real-time Interaction: The typing simulation runs in a separate thread, allowing you to interact with the program while the text is being typed.

**Installation**
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/human-writer.git
cd human-writer
Install the required Python packages: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then install the necessary packages using pip:

bash
pip install tkinter keyboard
Run the application:

bash
python human_writer.py
Usage
Launch the Program: Run the application using the command above.
Enter Text: Type or paste the text you want to simulate in the text box.
Start Typing Simulation: Click the "Write" button to start the typing simulation.
Adjust Speed: Use the "+" and "-" buttons to increase or decrease the typing speed. The estimated time to complete the typing will update automatically.
Stop Typing: Click the "Stop" button to halt the typing simulation at any point.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
keyboard library for simulating key presses
